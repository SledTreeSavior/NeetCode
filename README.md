My NeetCode 150 Joruney

# Description
I'm going to do a problem a day from NeetCode 150. Each problem will have two solutions and a write-up. The first solution will be my own. I'll start by using minimal resources, then allowing use of documentaiton, followed by StackOverflow. Once I have a working solution, I'll calculate time/space complexity. Then, I will look as solutions with better time/space complexity, and write it out as my second solution. Finally, I'll create a write-up describing my thought process in my own solution, followed by what I did good, what I could have done better, and how the optimal solution improved upon what I had written.
